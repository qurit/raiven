Artificial intelligence (AI) is finding an increasing number of applications in nuclear medicine and radiology. Deep
learning models have been used to improve image quality, automate image segmentation, and aid in disease classification.
Models that combine learned features, radiomic features, and clinical information can be used to predict disease progression,
treatment outcome and survival.

However, translation of such models/algorithms into clinical trials or standard of care applications is often nontrivial
due to the lack of an appropriate framework for model deployment. The aim of this project is to develop such a framework
that satisfies the following design specifications:

1. Allows easy combination of different algorithms to create pipelines with multistep workflows
2. Works with existing workstations available to physicians/researchers
3. Allows the deployment of models developed in any programming language without the need for cumbersome and time-consuming configuration
4. Is easy to deploy and use.

The RAIVEN (Radiology AI Virtual ENvironment) framework represents a vision of a new radiology environment that
incorporates AI tools to better treat and diagnose disease.

## Requirements

Raiven's backend is coded using [fastapi](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) and python 3.8. Raiven's frontend is coded
using [nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org) (a vuejs framework) and the [vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com/) material design framework.
All the requirements to run raiven can be installed with conda.

```
conda env create
```

**Note:** Raiven requires docker to be installed for the pipelining functionality.

## Deployment

The easiest way to deploy Raiven is using docker. Raiven comes with a preconfigured compose file.

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

Development can also be done without docker. Make sure you first have all the requirements installed.

```bash
# backend
cd backend
python asgi.py

# frontend
cd frontend
npm run build
```

### Database migrations

Database migrations can using alembic be done with the following commands:

```bash
alembic revision --autogenerate -m <message>  # Create a revision
alembic upgrade head # Upgrade to latest revision
```

## Documentation

The documentation for raiven was created with mkdocs-material. To test the documentation locally:

```bash
cd docs/en
python mkdocs serve
```

## Config

Configuration of Raiven can be done in multiple places. If you are using docker, configuration
can be done by modifying the `.env` file. Backend configuration can also be done by modifying `/backend/config.py` whilst
the frontend configuration can be done by modifying `/frontend/nuxt.config.js`. Configuration can also be done by
setting environment variables. The environment variables which can be set are found in `/backend/config.py`.
